# Chess-Analysis-Tool


This is a Python script that allows users to analyze chess boards from chess.com. To use the script, users need to first open the developer tools in Google Chrome and choose the "Elements" tab. Then, they can select the board element they want to analyze by clicking on it and using the icon at the top left that looks like a mouse cursor.

Once the element is selected, users can search for text that says: ( chess-board class="board" id="board-vs-personalities ) and right-click on the resulting element to select "Copy Element." The copied element can then be pasted into the script's text box, and can then press the "Analyze" button.

After the page loads, users can press the "Stockfish 11+HCE in Local Browser" button and move their pieces around to analyze how the game should be played. Enjoy!
